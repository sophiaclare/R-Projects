### [New Zealand Citizenship by Country of Birth](https://github.com/sophiaclare/R-Projects/blob/main/NZ%20Citizenship%20Project.nb.pdf)

**Description:** This project analyzes data on citizenship granted in New Zealand from 1949 to 2019, obtained from the Department of Internal Affairs.  The aim of the project is to identify the top five countries where people who earned New Zealand citizenship were born, and to analyze the trends in the number of citizenships granted to these countries over time.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** R, Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, scales

**Results:** The analysis identified the top five countries where migrants to New Zealand were born, which were England, India, South Africa, China, and Fiji. The analysis also revealed trends in the number of citizenships granted to these countries over time, indicating an increase in the number of citizenships granted to migrants from India and Fiji in recent years. The project's data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques provide valuable insights into the migration patterns of New Zealand over the last 70 years.
